    "final": "Plan:\n- Identify widely adopted, actively maintained AI code search tools.\n- Verify capabilities and differentiators from authoritative sources.\n- Recommend top 3 with short “best for” guidance and links.\n\nTop 3 AI code search tools\n\n1) Sourcegraph (Code Search + Cody)\n- What it is: Enterprise-grade code intelligence with semantic/natural language search, structural search, cross-repo navigation, and the Cody AI assistant for repo Q&A and code actions.\n- Why it stands out: Scale (monos/large orgs), rich code graph, embeddings-backed natural language search, deep IDE/editor integrations, strong compliance options.\n- Best for: Teams/orgs with large multi-repo or monorepo codebases needing precise and semantic search, and AI Q&A grounded in code.\n- Learn more: Product overview and capabilities https://sourcegraph.com; Cody and code search docs/overview https://docs.sourcegraph.com/cody and https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search\n\n2) Glean\n- What it is: Enterprise AI work assistant with unified search across tools (including GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) that provides semantic code search and code-aware answers, with permissions-aware indexing.\n- Why it stands out: Strong enterprise search across the whole toolstack plus code; semantic understanding and conversational Q&A with references; robust admin/governance.\n- Best for: Companies wanting a single AI search assistant spanning code and internal knowledge (issues, docs, PRs) with secure, org-wide context.\n- Learn more: Product page and code search overview https://www.glean.com/product and https://www.glean.com/integrations/github\n\n3) Bloop\n- What it is: AI-native code search that indexes your repos and lets you ask natural-language questions, find relevant code, and explore with semantic understanding. Desktop app and CLI options; developer-focused experience.\n- Why it stands out: Purpose-built AI code search with fast local/hosted indexing and pragmatic UX for developers; good for small-to-mid teams and individuals.\n- Best for: Developers and smaller teams wanting straightforward AI code search and repo Q&A without heavy enterprise overhead.\n- Learn more: Product site and docs https://bloop.ai and https://docs.bloop.ai\n\nNotes and selection rationale\n- GitHub’s core Code Search is excellent for structural/regex and symbol queries, while Copilot Chat provides repo-aware Q&A; however, Sourcegraph’s semantic code search depth, scale, and code graph make it a stronger dedicated AI code search choice for most orgs. See GitHub Code Search overview: https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/github-code-search/understanding-github-code-search and Copilot Chat for repo Q&A: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/about-github-copilot-chat\n- Amazon Q Developer also offers repo-aware Q&A in IDEs and the console, but it is broader as a dev assistant rather than a focused code search product. Info: https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/\n\nQuick recommendations\n- Large orgs, complex repos: Sourcegraph\n- Company-wide knowledge + code: Glean\n- Individual devs and small teams: Bloop\n\nIf you share your environment (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket, cloud/on-prem, size of repos, security constraints), I can tailor the pick and integration steps.",

    "final": "Quick plan:\n- Clarify that most “squirrels” don’t hibernate.\n- Explain who actually stores food vs who relies on body fat.\n- Give ballpark amounts with sources.\n\nAnswer:\n- Tree squirrels (gray, fox, red) do not hibernate. They stay active in winter and rely on caches of nuts and seeds. A single gray squirrel may make thousands of caches; studies and wildlife agencies note “several thousand” items cached each fall. Exact counts vary by habitat and mast crop, but think in the thousands of nuts/seeds rather than a fixed “pounds” target. They also fatten up slightly before winter. Sources: National Wildlife Federation; University of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum; state wildlife pages. Example overview: https://www.nwf.org/Garden-for-Wildlife/About/Native-Wildlife/Gray-Squirrel\n\n- Chipmunks (family Sciuridae, but not “tree squirrels”) don’t truly hibernate; they enter torpor and wake to eat stored food. They create a central larder in their burrow rather than scatter-hoarding. Field reports and extensions commonly note several pounds of seeds and nuts per chipmunk in the burrow, sometimes up to around 8 pounds, depending on food availability. See Mass Audubon’s species account: https://www.massaudubon.org/learn/nature-wildlife/mammals/chipmunks\n\n- True hibernators among squirrels are ground squirrels (e.g., thirteen-lined, golden-mantled, arctic ground squirrels). They typically do not eat during hibernation; instead they build large fat reserves beforehand. Many species gain 30–70% of body mass in fat before denning, with some doubling fat mass relative to summer. Example: University of Alaska Fairbanks on arctic ground squirrels and fat reliance during hibernation: https://www.uaf.edu/news/arctic-ground-squirrels-hibernate-in-extreme-cold.php\n\nPractical takeaway:\n- If you mean backyard “tree squirrels,” they don’t need a set amount “for hibernation” because they don’t hibernate. They cache thousands of nuts/seeds in fall and forage from those caches all winter.\n- Chipmunks store a central pantry of several pounds because they periodically wake to eat.\n- Ground squirrels rely mostly on body fat, not stored food, during hibernation.\n\nIf you tell me which species and location you’re asking about, I can give a tighter estimate for that animal.",
